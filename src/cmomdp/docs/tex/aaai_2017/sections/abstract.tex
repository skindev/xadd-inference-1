Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a powerful framework for decision-theoretic planning. Despite this their applicability is often limited by the common assumption that model parameters are known. Formalizing and solving MDPs in the presence of parameter uncertainty leads to a family of hybrid (mixed discrete and continuous state and action) MDPs with non-linear and/or piecewise structure. In this paper we show how these models can be formalized under the unifying framework of Parameterized Hybrid MDPs (PHMDPs). Furthermore, we leverage techniques from symbolic dynamic programming and advances in nonlinear solvers to provide the first algorithm to optimize policies and continuous actions in nonlinear PHMDPs. Our framework allows one to explore for the first-time: (i) inverse reinforcement learning under multiple rewards; (ii) nonlinear policy optimization for public health policies in epidemic models; and (iii) sensitivity analysis of trading strategies for portfolio transactions.


%Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a powerful framework for decision-theoretic planning. While MDPs occur in many applications, their applicability is limited by the common assumption that the model parameters are known. However, there are many settings where it is important to solve or evaluate MDPs in the presence of uncertainty over parameters, for example: (i) to investigate the trade-off between different reward criteria in a multi-objective setting; (ii) to perform sensitivity analyses of policies to various parameter settings; and (iii) to analyse and optimise policy performance as a function of policy parameters. However, formalizing MDPs in this way leads to a family of hybrid (mixed discrete and continuous state and action) MDPs with non-linear and/or piecewise structure. In this paper we show how each of the aforementioned use cases can be formalized under the common framework of parameterized hybrid MDPs and solved exactly and in closed-form by leveraging techniques from symbolic dynamic programming. Our novel framework allows one to explore for the first-time: (i) an exact functional representation of the
%multi-objective trade-offs for use in (Interactive) Decision Maps; (ii) exact sensitivity analysis of public health policies in epidemic models over the full range of infection rate parameters; and (iii) non-convex optimization of policy parameters applied to finance problems previously impossible with sample-based policy gradient techniques.
