\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we have introduced a unifying framework for parameterized hybrid MDPs which enables the investigation of trade-offs between multi-objective rewards, examination of parameter sensitivity and the optimization of continuous policy parameters. We have also presented a novel symbolic dynamic programming algorithm that be can be used to calculate exact solutions for domains modelled within this framework. The framework and algorithm was used to calculate the first known exact closed-form solutions to sensitivity analysis of public health policies in epidemic models and non-convex optimization of policy parameters within the optimal execution problem in finance.

There are a number of avenues for future research. Firstly, it is important to examine more general representations of the reward and transition functions while still guaranteeing exact solutions. Another direction of research lies within improving the scalability of the algorithm by either extending techniques for Algebraic Decision Diagrams~\parencite{Bahar_JoFMiSD_1993} from APRICODD~\parencite{St-Aubin_NIPS_2000} under the current restrictions on the reward and transition functions, bounded error compression for 
XADDs~\parencite{Vianna_UAI_2013} for more expressive representations, or lazy approximation of value functions as piecewise linear XADDs~\parencite{Li_AAAI_2005}. Search based approaches such as RTDP~\parencite{Barto_AI_1995} and HAO*~\parencite{Meuleau_JoAIR_2009}
are also readily adaptable to SDP. The advances made within this paper open up a number of potential novel research paths which may be used to progress solutions to multi-objective MDPs, sensitivity analysis and optimization of policy parameters.
