problem in MDPs is parameters and how to set them
trade-offs, sensitity to hyperparameters, stability under policies
problem is that formalization leads to hybrid MDPs with nonlinear and/or piecewise structure
recently the case calculus has provided tools and data structures for working in closed-form with symbolic nonlinear piecewise functions
we extends this work to provide exact solutions for parameterized MDPs
